# Test assignment

I have added a class ReferenceAndroid under com.abnamro.apps.referenceandroid which has 4 test cases implemented in java

1. verifyTitle() - This test verifies the Title of the page
2. verifyContent() - This test verifies the contend displayed in the page
3. verifySettings() - This test verifies the more options (three dots) available on the page and Settings options pops out when tap on three dots
4. verifyFloatButton() - This test verifies the available float button and the appeared snackbar upon clisking the float button, also gets disappeared after few seconds
